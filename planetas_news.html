			<h3>Update a0.02 - Review</h3>

			<p>
				A new update is now up on Mastersystem. In this update we reviewed and added a lot of content to our website. 
				Let's start by talking about what we've done to the "News" page: 
				As we like to give our users the best possible experience while they surf through our website we decided to totally redesign the "News" page to make it look more like a "News" page indeed.
				Well, now it looks like a newspaper! And we think it's more reader-friendly this way. The paper texture we added to the contents background makes it easy to read relaxing our eyes. 
				We're still thinking about how we're going to display images. We wanted to display them in the old fashion way, black and white, however we know how hard it could be for our users to
				understand what we want to show about this particular game. Since the game itself, Mastermind, requires a lot of colors we hardly think that an image (a screenshot) from the game in black and white 
				will send the message we want to share with the users. Still, what about pictures? We'll probably post them in black and white, one or another just to keep the classic newspaper style.
			</p>
			<p>
				Moving forward on the <a href="planetas_home.html">Homepage</a> you probably already noticed some changes, first of all we finally added content to the boxes that were empty on the previous versions.
				By clicking on box on the right you can easily access to the updates page which gives you information about the current version of the game and website as well as the previous ones.
				The bottom box is intended to people who are not familiar to the game but also to the users looking for information about the game. Clicking on this box will redirect you to a page with all the rules
				trick and tips, FAQ's and more about the Mastersystem. The design was also updated, now the boxes have some space between them and we add borders to highlight them a litle more. In future updates
				we plan on changing their backgroud as well.

			<p>
				Mastersystems logo was retouched. The previous one had some pixels problems and the background was not the best on thematic terms. This one is purple, the same color when you hover over the 
				navigation bar buttons. The icon that appears on the browser tab was also adjusted to be the same as the main logo.
			</p>
			<p>
				We changed some other little things. The "Updates" page finally has some content. A short summary of the content is displayed in the <a href="planetas_home.html">Homepage</a> so no user has the excuse of not be informed 
				about the last changes we made to the game. We'll try to be brief about updates information.
				Scoreboard is now displayed has a table in the game page and if you click on it, you'll be redirected to another page where you can see your scores as well as other players, time and points.
				Last but not least, some adjustments were made tp the Log In/Sign In page. The buttons were not properly aligned but now they are!
			</p>
			<p>
				Long story short, this was a huge update but we finally maneged to put some actual content on the website. All the maping stuff was done, the theme, images, everything was on point but we
				had no content. We still have a lot of work to do. In the next update we expect to add the Scoreboard page as well as the Rules page and we'll probably start working on the game itself.
